\markboth{Background}{Background}

In this section, I provide background on the \graphit DSL which allows programmers to describe graph algorithms separate from their scheduling optimizations.
I then provide background on manycore architectures and describe the representative manycore that we target with our code generator. 
\todo{write background on graph processing, graph topologies, graphs used in this thesis, and algorithms used}

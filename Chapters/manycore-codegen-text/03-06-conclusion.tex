\subsection{Conclusions}\label{sec:concl}

In this section, we presented our work developing a code generator for graph processing frameworks targeting a representative manycore architecture. 
We formalized a general execution model and presented a backend that supports code generation for this model on a manycore architecture that utilizes High Bandwidth Memory.
We proposed two manycore specific optimizations to improve performance across graph programs, and showed how existing graph processing optimizations can be ported to a manycore. 
A performance study found that our optimized manycore code achieves 467 million traversed edges per second (MTEPS) exceeding conventional architectures in a fraction of the die area.

%\todo{more conclusion here? paragraph on the impact/future implications?}

% Code generation offers us the ability to abstract away the complexity of writing performant manycore code from the specification of the graph application. 
% The \graphit DSL further allows us to more easily explore ways to improve performance across benchmarks and input graphs by separating the algorithm description from the scheduling of work.

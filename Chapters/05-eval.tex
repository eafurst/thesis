\chapter{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

In this chapter, we evaluate the performance of our code generation framework and its optimizations implemented as a \graphvm using the \ugc and outlined in Chapters~\ref{gen:sec:graphitbackend} and~\ref{gen:sec:optimizations}.
%We compare the performance of our generated code to a CPU baseline and evaluate the performance of each of the optimizations we outlined in Section~\ref{sec:method}.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter we presented performance results for our code generation framework introduced in Chapter~\ref{gen:sec:graphitbackend}.
We showed baseline code performance and explored the performance benefits of the optimizations we presented in Chapter~\ref{gen:sec:optimizations}.
We demonstrated speedups of up to $4.96\times$ when our manycore-specific optimizations are applied.
Our evaluation demonstrated that our \graphit backend and optimizations can improve high performance on a wide variety of input graphs and algorithms.
This is because our code generation framework enables flexible exploration of optimizations in order to find the optimal schedule for each benchmark and input graph.

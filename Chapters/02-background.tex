\markboth{Background}{Background}

In this chapter, we provide background on graph processing including descriptions of the algorithms and input graphs used for evaluation in this dissertation.
We then describe the \graphit DSL which allows programmers to describe graph algorithms separate from their scheduling optimizations.
Finally, we provide background on manycore architectures and describe the representative manycore that we target with our code generator.

\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, we first described graph processing at a high level before describing the behavior and structure of algorithms and input graphs used for evaluation in this dissertation.
We then described the \graphit DSL and its benefits.
In Chapter~\ref{gen:sec:graphitbackend} we use \graphit to implement our code generation framework as a backend to the language.
We also provided a description of the \hbmc architecture that we target in this work.

\markboth{Background}{Background}

In this chapter, I provide background on graph processing including descriptions of the algorithms and input graphs used for evaluation in this thesis.
I then describe the \graphit DSL which allows programmers to describe graph algorithms separate from their scheduling optimizations.
Finally, I provide background on manycore architectures and describe the representative manycore that we target with our code generator.

\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, I first described graph processing at a high level before describing the behavior and structure of algorithms and input graphs used for evaluation in this thesis.
I then described the \graphit DSL and its benefits.
In chapter~\ref{gen:sec:graphitbackend} we use \graphit to implement our code generation framework as a backend to the language.
I also provided a description of the manycore architecture that we target in this thesis.

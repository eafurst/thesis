%this paper looks at adding a small serial hardware addition to a gpu to compact the data for GPU processing. compaction essentially constructs a bitmask and then gets the appropriate subset of the edgelist and constructs a new subset edgelist for processing. they also try to coalesce and organize the data to improve cache efficiency and deduplicate data to reduce work

%this is one of beamer's papers on how best to measure graph system improvements. gives tradeoffs between algorithm improvements and system improvements. notes that often memory issues are latency bound since the bandwidth is rarely filled. says to report TEPS but also to report memory requests/edge and latency of memory requests.

%this is a beamer paper that motivated GAIL. talks about how the biggest issue in graph processing is that the memory bandwidth isn't saturated. Mention using more speculative execution to execute more memory requests, we could try this or just use our blocking to increase the memory request bandwidth. Note that the input graph changes a lot of memory access behavior. “Efforts to move computation rather than data fare best” biggest limiter is instruction window.

%proposes a vertex-centric graph processing architecture, support asynchrous execution (does not use strict iterations like traditional graph processing). This paper has a lot of good stats on CPU/GPU graph processing performance. Try to maintain a large active set of vertices/edges to increase MLP.

%They find that the memory bandwidth is limited due to load-load dependencies. That is, often in graph processing a memory load is dependent on the result of another memory load (i.e. need to look up edges of a vertex, then need to look up the parent array for those edge dest. vertices.)

  Abstract = {Massive datasets arise in a broad spectrum of scientific, engineering and commercial applications. In many practically important cases, a massive dataset can be represented as a very large graph with certain attributes associated with its vertices and edges. Studying the structure of this graph is essential for understanding the structural properties of the application it represents. Well-known examples of applying this approach are the Internet graph, the Web graph, and the Call graph. It turns out that the degree distributions of all these graphs can be described by the power-law model. Here we consider another important application---a network representation of the stock market. Stock markets generate huge amounts of data, which can be used for constructing the market graph reflecting the market behavior. We conduct the statistical analysis of this graph and show that it also follows the power-law model. Moreover, we detect cliques and independent sets in this graph. These special formations have a clear practical interpretation, and their analysis allows one to apply a new data mining technique of classifying financial instruments based on stock prices data, which provides a deeper insight into the internal structure of the stock market.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: High-throughput metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized our view on the structure and metabolic potential of microbial communities. However, analysis of metagenomic composition is often complicated by the high complexity of the community and the lack of related reference genomic sequences. As a start point for comparative metagenomic analysis, the researchers require efficient means for assessing pairwise similarity of the metagenomes (beta-diversity). A number of approaches were used to address this task, however, most of them have inherent disadvantages that limit their scope of applicability. For instance, the reference-based methods poorly perform on metagenomes from previously unstudied niches, while composition-based methods appear to be too abstract for straightforward interpretation and do not allow to identify the differentially abundant features.Results: We developed MetaFast, an approach that allows to represent a shotgun metagenome from an arbitrary environment as a modified de Bruijn graph consisting of simplified components. For multiple metagenomes, the resulting representation is used to obtain a pairwise similarity matrix. The dimensional structure of the metagenomic components preserved in our algorithm reflects the inherent subspecies-level diversity of microbiota. The method is computationally efficient and especially promising for an analysis of metagenomes from˘ novel environmental niches.Availability and Implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available for download at https://github.com/ctlab/metafast. The code is written in Java and is platform independent (tested on Linux and Windows x86\_64).Contact:ulyantsev@rain.ifmo.ruSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
